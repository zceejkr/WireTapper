# WireTapper

A wire tapper capable of decoding DTMF encoded telephone numbers from a signal. 

Contains some Arduino code to sample the analog signal in /sample.
The daq.m file aquires the data sent from the Arduino and stores them in Matlab.
Some example signals I have sampled are located in /example_data.
Run test.m for a demo.
